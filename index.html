            Installing a custom ROM requires you to root a device, which voids the warranty on most smartphones and if things go wrong, the process might even brick your device. So, do it only if you are sure and be careful.

                <h2>What is an Android Custom ROM?</h2>
                
                <p class="last">The term ROM, which stands for Read Only Memory and really has very little to do with what a custom Android ROM actually is, can be confusing. A custom Android ROM refers to a phone’s firmware, based on Google’s Android platform. Android is open source and therefore any developer can edit the code, recompile it, and re-release for a wide variety of devices. Users can install ROMs to change a device’s appearance and behavior. ROMs are developed by the Android community, often times by a group of core developers who do this purely out of passion for modding. This means that most are completely free. Custom ROMs are available for phones, tablets, media players, smart watches and almost any type of device running Android.

                <h4>Why use a Custom ROM?</h4>
                <section class="f1">
                    <strong>Performance</strong><br>
Out of the box, your phone or tablet’s hardware is clocked at a speed that the manufacturer considers optimal in terms of heat and battery life. On a custom ROM, you’ll be able to overclock your hardware to get big performance increases. These changes can really show when you’re playing graphics intensive games. Another way a ROM can improve performance is by removing carrier or OEM-installed apps, known as bloatware, which can free up system resources.

                <section class="f2">
                    <strong>Battery Life
                    </strong><br>
On the flip-side of overclocking, there’s underclocking. If you don’t really need all the speed of your massive processor, you can dial it back a bit by underclocking. With your processor running at a lower speed, you can often extend battery life by days! This is something to consider if you find yourself charging your phone multiple times per day. A custom ROM, again, by removing bloatware, can help free up the CPU to do less because there are fewer apps running in the background.

                <section class="f3"><strong>Updates
                </strong><br>
One of the most frustrating things about owning an Android is waiting for your manufacturer to push an update to your phone so you can get the latest features. Often times manufacturers will even cut support for your device entirely. This leaves you stuck with a phone with an old version of Android. The solution is a custom ROM on the newest Android version. Even if your phone is stuck on KitKat, you can download and flash a ROM based on Lollipop. Many of the more popular ROMs even update on a daily basis. These updates are called “Nightlies”.</section>
